## About The Project
![Screenshot](Screenshots/main.png)
A simple(for you, not me) Windows GUI app that lets you see the ranks, recent games and other info of players in a live Valorant match while you're still playing it. What you see above is what you get (for now).

### Current Features
Displays for each player:
|Current Rank|Past three ranks (from last 3 acts, not last 3 played acts)|W/L indicator for last three competitive games|Player card and Account Level|In-game name, Agent and Title|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
